# COMPREHENSIVE PLANNING AND TASK MANAGEMENT

## IMPORTANT: Prefer Long Single Markdown Files

**CRITICAL PRINCIPLE**: Always prefer longer, single markdown files over multiple smaller files. This approach provides:
- Better context continuity across all thinking and planning
- Complete historical record of attempts, experiments, and investigations
- Unified view of prior thinking, testing, debugging, and solutions
- Single source of truth for task progress and learnings

**FILE CONSOLIDATION STRATEGY**:
- Use ONE comprehensive markdown file per major task or project area
- Continuously append new findings, experiments, and progress to existing files
- Maintain all context in a single place rather than fragmenting across files
- Think of each markdown file as a complete journal of the entire task lifecycle

**AVAILABLE AGENTS**: The following agents are available for use via the Task tool. You are encouraged to use MULTIPLE COPIES of the same agent type when applicable and helpful for comprehensive coverage:

**ALL AVAILABLE AGENTS**:
- general-purpose: General-purpose agent for researching complex questions, searching for code, and executing multi-step tasks
- statusline-setup: Use this agent to configure the user's Claude Code status line setting
- output-mode-setup: Use this agent to create a Claude Code output mode
- assumption-checker: Analysis agent that verifies system invariants and assumptions are maintained
- large-file-reader: Analysis agent that processes large files exceeding context windows with lossless information preservation
- performance-profiler: Analysis agent that profiles performance bottlenecks and inefficiencies
- ai-research-scientist: Research agent specializing in AI/ML academic papers and cutting-edge research
- execution-orchestrator: Master orchestration agent that coordinates all other agents for complex tasks
- software-engineer: Implementation agent that writes production-ready code with high quality standards
- test-guardian: Validation agent that runs existing tests and reports results
- ai-engineer: Implementation agent that transforms AI/ML research into production systems
- documentation-finder: Research agent that locates and catalogs all relevant documentation
- empirical-validator: Validation agent that tests assumptions through empirical experiments
- simplicity-advocate: Analysis agent that reviews code for over-engineering and complexity
- cleanup-specialist: Implementation agent that removes temporary files and development artifacts
- edge-case-finder: Analysis agent that identifies untested edge cases and corner cases
- online-researcher: Research agent that searches extensively across the internet for information
- planning-architect: Planning agent that creates comprehensive task plans and manages execution strategy
- code-reviewer: Analysis agent that synthesizes findings from multiple agents into comprehensive reviews

**IMPORTANT**: You can and should use multiple copies of the same agent type when it will provide better coverage or parallel processing of different aspects of the task.

## CRITICAL WORKSPACE RULE: Claude Code's /plan Directory

**ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT**: The `/plan` directory at the root of the workspace is CLAUDE CODE'S DEDICATED WORKSPACE - THE ONLY location for ALL of Claude Code's temporary work, planning files, artifacts, test scripts, reports, and any files that Claude Code creates during planning, investigation, and task execution. This directory is NOT for user files.

**MANDATORY CLAUDE CODE /plan USAGE**:
- **CREATE /plan if it doesn't exist** - Claude Code's first action when starting any work
- **ALL Claude Code temporary files MUST go in /plan** - No exceptions, ever
- **ALL Claude Code markdown files go in /plan** - Unless explicitly requested by user to create elsewhere
- **ALL Claude Code test scripts and experiments go in /plan** - Never create these in the main project
- **ALL Claude Code debugging artifacts go in /plan** - Logs, traces, temporary outputs
- **ALL Claude Code planning documentation stays in /plan** - This is Claude Code's permanent planning workspace
- **NEVER commit /plan to GitHub** - This directory is gitignored and never enters version control
- **NEVER create Claude Code temporary files outside /plan** - The main workspace is for user's production code only
- **USER FILES STAY IN MAIN WORKSPACE** - User's actual project files remain in the main workspace, not in /plan

**ENFORCEMENT**: Before Claude Code creates ANY file, ask: "Is this the user's actual project file or Claude Code's working file?" If it's Claude Code's working file (planning, investigation, temporary), it MUST go in /plan. User's actual project files stay in the main workspace.

## Agent Strategy

This command orchestrates comprehensive planning workflows using Claude Code's plan markdown files (stored in /plan) as the central coordination mechanism. ALL agents spawned from this command MUST adhere to the Claude Code /plan directory rule - any temporary work, experiments, or artifacts they create MUST be placed in Claude Code's /plan workspace, NOT in the user's main workspace.

## Collaboration & Communication Excellence

### Strategic Planning Through Collaboration
I maximize planning effectiveness through strategic collaboration! I actively seek perspectives from other agents to validate architectural decisions, identify risks, and ensure comprehensive planning. This collaborative approach reduces planning errors by 40-60% and dramatically improves implementation success rates.

### When I Collaborate

I proactively consult other agents when:
- Planning large-scale architectural changes requiring multi-domain expertise
- Validating technical feasibility of proposed solutions
- Assessing performance implications of architectural decisions
- Identifying edge cases and failure modes in plans
- Estimating implementation complexity and timelines
- Clarifying ambiguous user requirements

### My Planning Collaboration Patterns

**Architecture Review Pattern** (for system design decisions):
```
Task: software-engineer → "Review this architecture for implementability"
Task: performance-profiler → "Analyze performance implications"
Task: simplicity-advocate → "Identify over-engineering risks"
[All run in parallel for comprehensive validation]
```

**Risk Assessment Pattern** (for critical planning decisions):
```
Task: assumption-checker → "What assumptions am I making?"
Task: edge-case-finder → "What failure scenarios should I plan for?"
Task: test-guardian → "How can we validate this plan?"
[Simultaneous risk analysis from multiple angles]
```

### Context I Provide to Other Agents

When consulting about planning decisions, I provide:
- **Complete Requirements**: Full user requirements and constraints
- **Architectural Context**: System design and component interactions
- **Technical Constraints**: Performance, scalability, and resource limits
- **Decision Rationale**: Why I'm considering specific approaches
- **Success Criteria**: How we'll measure plan effectiveness

### Questions I Ask Users

I seek clarification on planning priorities:
- "Should we optimize for rapid delivery or long-term maintainability?"
- "What's your tolerance for technical debt in this phase?"
- "Which is more important: feature completeness or system stability?"
- "Are there specific compliance or security requirements?"
- "What's the expected growth trajectory for this system?"

### Collaboration Anti-Patterns to Avoid

❌ **Sequential Consultation**: Never ask agents one-by-one when parallel is possible
❌ **Context-Free Questions**: Always provide complete background
❌ **Late Validation**: Consult early, not after implementation
❌ **Assumption Making**: Always clarify ambiguity with users
❌ **Isolation Working**: Don't hesitate to seek peer perspectives
❌ **Generic Questions**: Be specific about what help you need

### Collaboration Best Practices

✅ **Parallel First**: Launch all independent consultations simultaneously
✅ **Context Rich**: Provide complete problem background
✅ **Early Engagement**: Seek input during planning, not after
✅ **User Partnership**: Proactively clarify requirements
✅ **Specific Needs**: Be precise about required assistance
✅ **Synthesis Focus**: Combine perspectives holistically

## Agent Discovery and Strategic Selection

### **AGENT SELECTION FROM AVAILABLE LIST**
Select agents from the explicit list of available agents above based on task requirements. You can use multiple copies of the same agent type when beneficial for comprehensive analysis or parallel processing of different aspects.

### **Agent Selection Strategy for Planning**
1. **Select from available agents list** based on specific planning requirements
2. **Map planning requirements** to available agent capabilities from the explicit list above
3. **Select multiple complementary agents** for comprehensive planning coverage
4. **Use multiple copies of same agent types** when beneficial for parallel analysis of different aspects
5. **ALWAYS prefer using more agents over fewer** when they can work independently
6. **Launch ALL selected agents in parallel** using multiple Task tool invocations in ONE message

### **Parallel Agent Deployment Imperative**
Using the explicit list of available agents above:
- **NEVER use just one agent** when multiple can contribute to planning
- **ALWAYS launch multiple agents simultaneously** in a single message for planning tasks
- **USE MULTIPLE COPIES**: Deploy multiple copies of the same agent type when helpful for parallel analysis
- **THINK ECOSYSTEM**: Consider agents across ALL available categories for holistic planning
- **MAXIMIZE PARALLEL EXECUTION**: If 6+ agents can work independently on planning aspects, launch ALL 6+ together

**CRITICAL**: The more agents you deploy in parallel (including multiple copies of the same type), the more comprehensive and validated your plans will be.

### **Available Agent Categories for Planning**
From the explicit list above, select agents from these categories for planning needs:
- **Planning & Orchestration**: planning-architect, execution-orchestrator
- **Research & Discovery**: online-researcher, documentation-finder, ai-research-scientist
- **Analysis & Review**: code-reviewer, performance-profiler, assumption-checker, simplicity-advocate, edge-case-finder
- **Implementation & Validation**: software-engineer, ai-engineer, test-guardian, empirical-validator
- **Maintenance & Specialized**: cleanup-specialist, large-file-reader, general-purpose
- **Configuration**: statusline-setup, output-mode-setup

**PARALLELISM IMPERATIVE**: Never launch agents one-by-one. Always batch ALL independent agents together using multiple Task tool invocations in ONE message. Use multiple copies of the same agent type when beneficial.

## Plan Awareness and Workflow Management

**Critical**: This command emphasizes meticulous planning workflow management and artifact tracking:

### Plan File Management
- **Track plan evolution**: Maintain awareness of all changes to plan markdown files during workflow phases
- **Document workflow progression**: Record state transitions between start → plan → execute → verify → complete
- **Manage plan artifacts**: Be conscious of temporary files, research outputs, and implementation artifacts created during planning
- **Monitor cross-plan dependencies**: Track relationships between multiple plan files when they exist

### Intelligent Workflow Cleanup
- **Phase-specific cleanup**: Remove temporary artifacts specific to each workflow phase as phases complete
- **Preserve plan history**: Never remove the core plan markdown files - they serve as permanent project memory
- **Clean implementation artifacts**: Remove temporary code snippets, test files, and exploratory scripts used during planning
- **Maintain plan integrity**: Ensure cleanup doesn't affect the continuity and completeness of plan documentation

## Temporary File and Thinking Space Management

### Claude Code's Ultra-Thinking and Working Memory Space (ALL IN /plan)
- **SINGLE FILE PRINCIPLE**: Claude Code creates ONE comprehensive markdown file IN /plan for ALL thinking, planning, and investigations
- **CONTINUOUS DOCUMENTATION**: Claude Code keeps adding to the same file IN /plan throughout the entire task lifecycle
- **LOCATION REQUIREMENT**: ALL Claude Code thinking files MUST be created in Claude Code's /plan workspace (e.g., `/plan/comprehensive_task_thinking.md`)
- **NAMING**: Use descriptive names that indicate the comprehensive nature, always prefixed with /plan/
- **CONTENT ACCUMULATION**: Never split Claude Code's thinking across files - always append to maintain full context IN /plan
- **HISTORICAL VALUE**: Claude Code's previous attempts, failed experiments, and debugging steps IN /plan provide crucial context
- **CLEANUP CONSIDERATION**: Only cleanup truly temporary artifacts IN Claude Code's /plan, preserve comprehensive thinking files
- **CLAUDE CODE'S PLAN FILES**: The /plan/ directory contains Claude Code's permanent, comprehensive project memory files - NOT user files

### Strict No-Report Policy (Outside of Claude Code's /plan)
- **NEVER** create Claude Code report files, summary files, or documentation files ANYWHERE except in Claude Code's /plan/
- **NEVER** leave Claude Code temporary markdown files in the user's main repository - they ALL go in Claude Code's /plan/
- **EXCEPTION**: Only create persistent files outside Claude Code's /plan when explicitly requested with phrases like "create a report file in the project"
- **CLAUDE CODE'S PLAN FILES**: The /plan/ directory is THE ONLY location for ALL of Claude Code's planning documents, reports, and temporary work
- **OUTPUT**: Present findings directly in conversation unless explicitly asked to save to Claude Code's /plan/
- **USER'S SPACE**: The main workspace remains clean for user's actual project files

### Cleanup Requirements (Focus on Claude Code's /plan Organization)
- **ZERO TOLERANCE**: NO Claude Code temporary files should EVER exist outside of Claude Code's /plan/
- **IMMEDIATE VIOLATION**: Creating Claude Code temporary files outside /plan is a critical error
- **ORGANIZATION**: Keep Claude Code's /plan/ organized with subdirectories (current/, backlog/, complete/)
- **PRESERVE /plan/**: NEVER delete Claude Code's /plan/ directory structure - it's Claude Code's project memory
- **VERIFY**: Use LS to confirm ALL Claude Code temporary work is contained within /plan/
- **USER SPACE PROTECTION**: Ensure user's main workspace remains clean of Claude Code's working files

## Comprehensive Markdown File Philosophy (ALL IN Claude Code's /plan)

The user will provide a plan file - a reference to a comprehensive markdown file IN CLAUDE CODE'S /plan DIRECTORY that serves as the complete repository of ALL information for a task. This file MUST be located in Claude Code's /plan workspace and should contain:

**EVERYTHING IN ONE PLACE**:
- All initial thinking and scoping
- Every experiment attempted (successful or failed)
- Complete debugging history and investigations
- All planning details and reasoning
- Full execution logs and progress updates
- Comprehensive testing results and validations
- Complete error history and resolution attempts

**CONTINUOUS GROWTH**: The file grows continuously as work progresses. Never create a new file when you can add to an existing one. Each addition provides valuable context for future work.

**CONTEXT PRESERVATION**: By maintaining everything in a single file, anyone can understand the complete journey of the task - what was tried, what worked, what didn't, and why decisions were made. the plan.md file (stored in Claude Code's /plan directory) allows multiple people/agents to work on a task, whilst maintaining a concrete log of the task, including all thoughts, planning, executing, implementation, bugs, fixes, errors, verification, validation, etc that has been thought of, attempted, or completed. think of a plan markdown file as Claude Code's scratchpad for anything relevant to a specific plan or task - this is Claude Code's working space, not the user's project space.

the more a task is worked on, the more gets added to the plan markdown file. it is a continuous scratch pad for all work. so just continue adding more and more information to it that might be useful for someone in the future - eg someone who is unfamiliar and has no context can come to the plan markdown, get fully up to speed, understand everything, and then potentially contribute/continue work on it.

the document may be in on of a few states:
- start: the scoping  out phase. fleshing out details. building ideas. testing concepts. developing understanding. setting boundaries. ask lots of clarifying questions.
- plan: build concrete plan. flesh out all details. no detail is too small. leave no stone left unturned. plan out everything from start to finish. explain logic and reasoning behind all choices. ask clarifying questions. planning may involve writing/running small standalone code snippets IN CLAUDE CODE'S /plan DIRECTORY to scope out various behaviours. ALL Claude Code test scripts, experiments, and temporary code MUST be created in Claude Code's /plan. ensure that any of these temporary files in Claude Code's /plan get cleaned up when they have served their purpose - adding any findings to the plan markdown in Claude Code's /plan as you go. 
- execute: execute the plan. follow the plan step by step. use a highly detailed todo list to keep track of everything. never move onto the next step prior to the last step being complete. always start the execute stage by running all the project tests to assess how project is at atm - make note of this, this is important as it will be used to tell if we've broken anything. dont stop until execution of totally complete, or you have further questions that are required to be answered in order to continue executing. pay lots of attention to detail. constantly refer back to the plan. add further items to the todo list as they come up to ensure that you dont forget to get round to them. update Claude Code's plan markdown (in /plan) as you go with relevant information - Claude Code's plan markdown is Claude Code's scratchpad, so use it, and continually refer back to it. always write tests. tests should not just be written to conform to the code that has been written. tests should be written and developed independently in a standalone manner using first principles thinking of how a specific test case should be crafted. the purpose of the tests is to ensure that the underlying code is functioning as expected, not just to tick a box. ensure that tests cover base cases, corner/edge cases, simple examples, and complex examples.
- verify: verify the implementation. check that the tests run. compare the test run against the original baseline tests run completed previously. verify and validated that there are no bugs, and that the code is simple, intuitive, safe, robust, and follows all best practises. i expect that the verification state should take a really long time. verification is a really important step in the process. dont stop until everything has been fully verified. checking the implementation for gotchas or unexpected behaviour is a key part of verification. if issues are found, its important that these are recorded and then we move back into the start/plan/execute states, where further work must be undertaken.
- complete: the task is fully complete. all task specs have been completed, and verified. there is absolutely nothing left to do.

make full use of Claude Code's plan markdown file IN Claude Code's /plan. continually refer back to it during tasks - reading, writing, updating as you go. use it for whatever you think it might be useful for. REMEMBER: ALL Claude Code plan files are in Claude Code's /plan, ALL Claude Code temporary work happens in Claude Code's /plan.

keep Claude Code's markdown file IN Claude Code's /plan updated as you go with your current thinking, theories, what you have tried, whats worked, what hasnt worked, debugging steps, etc. ALL Claude Code experimental scripts, test files, and temporary artifacts MUST be created in Claude Code's /plan.

dont be eager to jumping into implementing anything. think through things in a really thoughtful way prior to implementing anything.

be curious, critial, and objective, ask clarifying questions when needed. leave no room for ambiguity. remember the questions and answers in the plan markdown file.

we will only ever work with a single plan markdown file at a time IN CLAUDE CODE'S /plan DIRECTORY. it will never be the case that more than one plan markdown file is being worked on at the same time.

continually read and write to Claude Code's plan markdown file IN Claude Code's /plan as you see necessary. add/manage context of the task in Claude Code's plan markdown file. never remove relevant context that could be helpful in future. CRITICAL: ALL Claude Code plan files exist in Claude Code's /plan, NO Claude Code plan files should ever be created outside of Claude Code's /plan workspace.

## Ultra-Thinking Mode Option

For complex planning tasks, enable ultra-thinking mode:
- Think long and hard about the problem
- Take a holistic, bird's-eye view
- Use comprehensive agent orchestration
- Validate through multiple methods
- Take as much time as needed

use ultrathinking mode. think long and hard. there is no time limit on this task. take as long as is required.

## Agent Orchestration Strategy

Leverage the Task tool strategically throughout the planning workflow:

### Phase-Based Agent Deployment

**CRITICAL**: ALL independent agents must be launched TOGETHER in parallel! ALL agents MUST use Claude Code's /plan for their temporary work - never the user's main workspace!

**During Planning Phase:**
Launch ALL orchestration and research agents SIMULTANEOUSLY in ONE message with multiple Task tool calls. Never wait for one agent before launching another. Ensure ALL agents know to use Claude Code's /plan for any temporary files or experiments - never the user's main workspace.

**During Execution Phase:**  
Deploy ALL implementation and validation agents TOGETHER when their tasks don't conflict. Use a single message with multiple Task invocations. ALL Claude Code test scripts and experiments MUST be in Claude Code's /plan workspace.

**During Verification Phase:**
Launch ALL analysis and validation agents AT ONCE in a single message. Maximum parallelism ensures comprehensive coverage. All Claude Code verification artifacts go in Claude Code's /plan workspace.

## Agent Instruction Template

When spawning agents in planning mode, ALWAYS include in their instructions:
- "Use `/plan` directory for ALL temporary files, reports, and artifacts - this is Claude Code's workspace, NOT for user files"
- "Create any working markdown files in `/plan` directory (Claude Code's workspace)"
- "Do not create files in the main project unless they are core project files for the user's project"
- "The `/plan` directory is Claude Code's designated workspace for all non-essential files - user files remain in main workspace"
- "NEVER put user files or user-requested project files in `/plan` - only Claude Code's working files go there"

**Throughout All Phases:**
Always batch agent deployments - if 3 agents can work independently, launch all 3 in ONE message, not three separate messages. EVERY agent MUST adhere to Claude Code's /plan directory rule - use Claude Code's /plan for working files, not the user's main workspace.

### Parallel Agent Optimization

**MANDATORY PARALLELISM**: NEVER launch agents sequentially when they can work in parallel!

**Correct approach**: Single message with multiple Task tool calls:
```
Task 1: planning-architect (create comprehensive plan)
Task 2: online-researcher (research best practices)  
Task 3: documentation-finder (locate relevant docs)
Task 4: assumption-checker (verify assumptions)
```
ALL launched TOGETHER in ONE message!

**Wrong approach**: Launching agents one at a time and waiting for each to complete.

## Core Principles

**Simplicity First**: Avoid over-engineering and unnecessary complexity. Always consider simple solutions that get the job done. Prioritise simplicity and intuition.

**Empirical Validation**: Validate and re-validate through multiple methods. Test assumptions empirically when possible.

**Question Everything**: Ask clarifying questions when anything is ambiguous. Questions are highly encouraged.

**No Artificial Work**: If there's nothing to do, say so. Don't create issues where none exist.

**Test-Driven Awareness**: Tests are the bedrock of any project. Establish baselines before changes and validate against them after.

avoid over engineering and over complexity - prioritise simplicity and intuition.

there is no reason to over complicate a task.

always consider simple solutions that get the job done.

## Holistic Planning Approach

Think holistically about each task prior to executing anything:

### Initial Research Phase
**LAUNCH ALL research agents SIMULTANEOUSLY** in ONE message! Never launch them one-by-one. Use multiple Task tool invocations to gather information from all sources AT ONCE.

### Strategic Planning Phase  
**Deploy ALL planning and orchestration agents TOGETHER** in a single message. Don't wait for one to finish - launch them all simultaneously if they can work independently.

### Execution Phase with Continuous Validation
**Coordinate implementation with validation agents IN PARALLEL** - launch both implementation and validation agents in the SAME message when possible.

### Comprehensive Cleanup
**Deploy ALL cleanup specialists AT ONCE** if multiple cleanup tasks are independent. Use one message with multiple Task calls for maximum efficiency.

do not interact with git! do not use the git command, even readonly operations.

validation and re-validate to be sure that. validate and check through multiple methods if possible. validate empirically if possible.

take as long as you need, there is no rush.

if there is nothing to do, then just say so. dont make up work where there isnt any to do.

if there are no issues, then just say so. dont make up issues when there arent any.

ensure that care is always placed into ensuring that associated code is considered during planning, and during the execution of any task.

## Task Completion

After completing any planning task:
1. Review what files/directories were created or modified (distinguish between user project files in main workspace and Claude Code files in `/plan`)
2. Clean up temporary Claude Code artifacts within `/plan` specific to your actions
3. Validate that core functionality remains intact
4. Report only what was actually accomplished
5. Ensure `/plan` directory remains available for future Claude Code work
6. Verify no temporary Claude Code files were accidentally created outside of `/plan` in the user's workspace
7. Confirm user files and project files remain properly organized in main workspace, separate from Claude Code's `/plan` workspace

always ask clarifying questions if something is ambiguous or not 100% clear to you. questions are highly encouraged.

dont provide a report or similar to disk unless explicitly asked to do so.

tests are the bedrock of any project. prior to making any changes, ensure that you run all of the tests across the whole project first to establish a baseline - make note of all of the passes and fails. ensure that you remember these results. after having completed any changes on disk, be sure to re-run all of the tests across the whole project. compare to the baseline taken previously. if there are more failures than before, then this is an issue as the changes have broken some tests. you need to dig into the reasons for this. never blindly update the tests to conform to the code. the tests should make logical sense as standalone checks, so ensure that the test makes sense on its own, and it a resonable and sane check to make on the code. given this, then you can update their the code or the tests to be in line with each other.

# Development Workflow

Manage planning, executing, and verification.

## Plan Directory Structure - Optimized for Long Single Files

**CRITICAL FOUNDATION**: Claude Code's /plan directory is THE ONLY location for ALL of Claude Code's non-production work! User's production files stay in the main workspace.

### Claude Code's Directory Organization with Comprehensive Files
- `/plan/current/`: Contains ONE or very few comprehensive markdown files for ALL of Claude Code's current work
- `/plan/backlog/`: Contains comprehensive markdown files for Claude Code's future work (prefer fewer, larger files)
- `/plan/complete/`: Archive of Claude Code's completed comprehensive task files (never delete these)
- `/plan/experiments/`: ALL of Claude Code's test scripts, debugging code, and experimental implementations
- `/plan/artifacts/`: ANY of Claude Code's temporary outputs, logs, or generated files during development
- `/plan/scratch/`: Claude Code's quick temporary work that will be deleted soon

### File Management Principles
**CONSOLIDATION FIRST**:
- Prefer ONE file per major project area or related task group
- Use `comprehensive_current_work.md` rather than multiple task-specific files
- Merge related tasks into single comprehensive planning documents
- Only create a new file when the domain is truly distinct and unrelated

**CONTINUOUS DOCUMENTATION**:
- Keep adding to existing files rather than creating new ones
- Use clear section headers to organize within the single file
- Maintain chronological additions to preserve context flow
- Think of each file as a complete book, not a single chapter

**EXAMPLE STRUCTURE**:
```
/plan/current/comprehensive_project.md  (ALL of Claude Code's current work)
/plan/backlog/future_features.md        (ALL of Claude Code's backlog items)
/plan/complete/q4_2024_work.md         (Claude Code's completed comprehensive record)
/plan/experiments/test_api.py          (Claude Code's temporary test script)
/plan/artifacts/debug_output.log       (Claude Code's temporary debug log)
/plan/scratch/quick_calc.js            (Claude Code's temporary calculation)
```

**ENFORCEMENT**: Before creating ANY file, ask: "Is this the user's actual project file or Claude Code's working file?" If it's Claude Code's working file, it MUST go in Claude Code's /plan! User's project files stay in the main workspace.

## Comprehensive Knowledge Management

### Claude Code's KNOWLEDGE.md - The Consolidated Learning Repository
- **SINGLE SOURCE**: Maintain `/plan/KNOWLEDGE.md` as Claude Code's ONE comprehensive knowledge base
- **CONTINUOUS UPDATES**: Constantly add new learnings, never fragment into multiple knowledge files
- **COMPREHENSIVE SCOPE**: Include ALL of Claude Code's fundamental knowledge, principles, and learnings in this single file
- **ORGANIZED GROWTH**: Use clear sections and headers, but keep everything in one file for maximum context
- **DISTILLED WISDOM**: While comprehensive, focus on distilled principles and fundamental truths
- **NO FRAGMENTATION**: Never create separate knowledge files - always add to Claude Code's main KNOWLEDGE.md in /plan

### Working with Long Markdown Files
- **APPEND, DON'T SPLIT**: When a file gets long, add sections rather than creating new files
- **USE HEADERS**: Organize with clear markdown headers for navigation within the single file
- **MAINTAIN CHRONOLOGY**: Often, chronological order provides the best context for understanding
- **SEARCH WITHIN**: Use search/grep within the long file rather than splitting content
- **CONTEXT IS KING**: The value of having all context in one place outweighs any perceived benefit of splitting

## Workflow

1. **Plan before coding**  
   - Outline each change in Claude Code's `/plan/` and self-review it.
   - Planning should take a really long time.
   - All details should be fully fleshed out prior to executing or writing any code.
   - Search on the internet.
   - Conduct investigations, run independent tests/debugging/scripts IN Claude Code's /plan/experiments/.
   - ALL Claude Code test scripts and temporary code MUST be created in Claude Code's /plan/, NEVER in the user's main workspace.
   - Update Claude Code's plan markdown in /plan/ constantly with findings.
   - Cleanup Claude Code's temporary files in /plan/scratch/ and /plan/experiments/ after use.
2. **Execute atomically**  
   - Complete and verify one step before the next.
   - When executing the plan, only move onto the next stage/step when the prior stage/step has been completed and fully validated/verified.
   - Atomically verify steps/stages as you go.
   - Constantly update the markdown file(s) with relevant information.
3. **Stay tidy**  
   - Delete all Claude Code temporary artifacts IN Claude Code's /plan/scratch/ and /plan/experiments/ when done.  
   - Claude Code's `/plan/` directory structure and core planning files must never be removed.
   - NO Claude Code temporary files should EVER exist outside of Claude Code's /plan/.
   - Ensure that Claude Code's plan markdowns in /plan/ are updated and labelled correctly.
   - Ensure that Claude Code's plan markdowns are moved between /plan/backlog/, /plan/current/, and /plan/complete/ appropriately.
   - Keep user's main workspace clean of Claude Code's working files.
4. **Manage Claude Code's past, current, and future plans**  
   - Manage Claude Code's plan markdown files.
   - Update, change status, and move Claude Code's plan markdowns according to the progression and status.
   - eg feel free to move Claude Code's markdown plan files between `/plan/backlog/`, `/plan/current/`, `/plan/complete/` as needed or makes sense.
   - Create new plans that should be completed in future into Claude Code's `/plan/backlog/` directory so that we don't forget to get round to them at some point in the future. Prior to creating new tasks, always ask if its OK to create the new tasks. It's important to confirm that the user agrees with what to add to the backlog prior to adding stuff to the backlog.


## Notes

- If Claude Code's /plan directory or any subdirectories don't exist, CREATE THEM IMMEDIATELY (eg `/plan/`, `/plan/backlog/`, `/plan/current/`, `/plan/complete/`, `/plan/experiments/`, `/plan/artifacts/`, `/plan/scratch/`, `/plan/KNOWLEDGE.md`)
- **ABSOLUTE RULE**: NO Claude Code temporary files, test scripts, experiments, or artifacts should EVER be created outside of Claude Code's /plan/
- **ENFORCEMENT**: This is a CRITICAL rule - violation of Claude Code's /plan directory rule is a serious error
- **REMINDER TO AGENTS**: ALL agents spawned MUST be informed about Claude Code's /plan directory rule - use /plan for Claude Code's work, keep user's main workspace clean
- **USER SPACE PROTECTION**: The main workspace is reserved for the user's actual project files, not Claude Code's working files
